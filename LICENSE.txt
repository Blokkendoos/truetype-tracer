This source gets compiled into 2 executables. The first, ttt generates
G-code from a true type font and a text string. The second executable
is ttt_dxf which generates an autocad dxf file from a true type font
and a text string.

example commandline:
ttt "Hello World" > hw.ngc
ttt_dxf "Hello World" > hw.dxf

MANY THANKS go to Lawrence Glaister <ve7it@shaw.ca> for updates based
on the new FreeType FT_Outline API and .pfb support!
